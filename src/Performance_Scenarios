Performance approach:

Scenarios:

Search for products with various filters and verify search response time under load.

Add multiple products (different categories and options) to cart simultaneously from multiple users.

Perform checkout including applying discounts, payment processing, and order confirmation.

Simulate guest vs logged-in users for cart persistence and checkout speed.

Test API endpoints related to product catalog, cart, and order submission for response times.

Important Parameters to Measure:

Response Time: Time taken for each critical action (search, add to cart, checkout).

Throughput: Number of requests handled per second.

Error Rate: Percentage of failed transactions under load.

Concurrent Users: Number of users the system supports before degradation.
